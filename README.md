# MMLL-demo

Demonstrations of the [Musketeer Machine Learning Library (MMLL)](https://github.com/Musketeer-H2020/MMLL) using [Musketeer's pycloudmessenger](https://github.com/IBM/pycloudmessenger/)

## Installation

You may install pycloudmessenger and other library dependencies as follows:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Or if you only require pycloudmessenger, then:

`pip install http://github.com/IBM/pycloudmessenger/archive/v0.7.0.tar.gz`

The pycloudmessenger package requires a credentials file to access the cloud service. Please, place the `musketeer.json` credentials at the `demos/demo_pycloudmessenger/` folder.

## Usage

Please visit every subfolder in `demo/demo_pycloudmessenger/` for a detailed explanation about how to run the demos.

If you encounter any difficulties in the installation of some of the dependencies, please refer to the `install` instructions in this repository.

* Requirements Note: if you do not use conda to install and use pip instead, you may need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

## Input data

The datasets needed to run these demos are located at [IBM Box](https://ibm.box.com/s/l8yzdbdb40j499o513hygx5q85xyoz6v). Please, download and place them in your local `input_data/` folder. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: These datasets have been modified with respect to their original versions and are only intended to be used in these demos. Use them for other purposes under your own responsability.
