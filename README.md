# MMLL-demo

Demonstrations of the [Musketeer Machine Learning Library (MMLL)](https://github.com/Musketeer-H2020/MMLL) using [Musketeer's pycloudmessenger](https://github.com/IBM/pycloudmessenger/)

## Installation

You may install pycloudmessenger and other library dependencies as follows:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Or if you only require pycloudmessenger, then:

`pip install http://github.com/IBM/pycloudmessenger/archive/v0.7.0.tar.gz`

The pycloudmessenger package requires a credentials file to access the cloud service. Please, place the `musketeer.json` credentials at the `demos/demo_pycloudmessenger/` folder.

### Preprocessing:
* **Check data**: Check that the provided data at workers is in accordance with the data type description.
* **Conversion to numeric**: Conversion of categorical features to numeric.
* **Data alignment estimation**: Obtain the degree of alignment of each worker with respect to a reference dataset at MasterNode using different metrics.
* **Ad-hoc preprocessing**: Preprocess data at workers using logarithmic scale transformation and outlier clipping.
* **Image reshape**: Preprocess data at workers changing the height and width of images and vectorization.
* **Normalization**: Normalize data at workers to either have zero mean and stardard deviation one, or to be within zero and one.
* **Noise injection**: Adds noise to thr input data.
* **Principal component analysis**: Dimensionality reduction at workers using PCA algorithm.
* **Greedy feature selection**: Greedy feature selection at workers using a linear model.
* **Frequency feature selection**: Remove some features at workers based on frequency of appearance.
* **Random projection**: Sparse random projection to a lower dimensional space.
* **Deep learning**: Transformation of any image into a vector of size 1000 using AlexNet.
* **Natural language processing**: NLP transformation using TF-IDF.
* **Record linkage**: Linkage of samples for vertical partitioning datasets.
* **Missing data imputation**: Missing data imputation for vertical partitioning datasets.
* **Data value estimation (a priori)**: Data value estimation for every worker using different metrics.
* **Data value estimation (a posteriori)**: Data value estimation for every worker using AUC with a greedy incremental approach.

The output files are stored in the corresponding `results/` folder.

## Usage

Please visit every subfolder in `demo/demo_pycloudmessenger/` for a detailed explanation about how to run the demos.

If you encounter any difficulties in the installation of some of the dependencies, please refer to the `install` instructions in this repository.

* Requirements Note: if you do not use conda to install and use pip instead, you may need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
