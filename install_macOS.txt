=====================================================================================

- It is adviceable to install a python distribution like Anaconda (Python 3.7). Please proceeed to the Anaconda download page (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and follow the instructions according to your Operative System

- Once Anaconda is correctly installed, open a zsh terminal and execute the following commands:

conda update conda

conda update anaconda

- Next, we create a conda environment with the base requirements and activate it:

conda create --name MMLL_demo python=3.7.4 git gmpy2==2.0.8 -cdefaults -c conda-forge --yes

conda activate MMLL_demo

- Clone the repository with the demos:

git clone https://github.com/Musketeer-H2020/MMLL-demo.git

- And, finally, go into the root directory and install the requirements:

cd MMLL-demo

pip install -r requirements.txt

You may need some assistance from a System Manager if you fail to install the Python required libraries.
